To build a GPU cluster for shared use, follow these steps:

Hardware Setup:

Acquire GPU Nodes: Get multiple machines with GPUs. Ensure each machine has sufficient RAM and CPU to support the GPU's performance.

Networking: Connect these machines through a high-speed network, ideally with low latency and high bandwidth.

Operating System and Drivers:

Install Linux: Use a robust distribution like Ubuntu or CentOS.

Install GPU Drivers: Install NVIDIA CUDA drivers, or appropriate drivers for your GPUs.

Cluster Management Software:

Install Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an excellent tool for orchestrating containers across multiple machines.

Install Kubernetes Cluster: Use tools like kubeadm to set up the cluster. Designate one machine as the master and the others as workers.

Install Helm: Helm helps manage Kubernetes applications.

Containerization:

Install Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on all nodes for container management.

Create Docker Images: Build Docker images with the necessary machine learning frameworks and libraries.

Deploy GPU Workloads:

NVIDIA Device Plugin: Install the NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes to manage GPU resources.

Deploy Workloads: Use Helm or Kubernetes YAML files to deploy machine learning workloads to the cluster.

User Access and Management:

Authentication and Authorization: Set up user authentication using tools like Kubernetes RBAC.

Job Scheduling: Implement job schedulers like SLURM for workload management.

Monitoring and Maintenance:

Monitoring Tools: Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor cluster performance.

Regular Updates: Keep your system updated with the latest security patches and software updates.

Documentation and Support:

Provide Clear Documentation: Ensure users have access to comprehensive guides on how to use the cluster.

Support Channels: Set up support channels, like a dedicated email or chat group, for user queries and issues.
